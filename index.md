## Welcome to the official LuaSharp project page

LuaSharp (Lua#) is a library specific to rbx.LUA which eases coding to new programmers due to premade functions.

```markdown
userdata = {}
userdatabackups = {}
import ("IsCool",userdata,true)
```
This is an example of LuaSharp being used.
The result of this code will be variable IsCool being added to userdata and its value set to true, in a singular line of code.
